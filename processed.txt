prot1_155871  for the induction of icam-1  vcam-1  and prot2_6401  elam prot2_6401 -1  ||9269771_155871_6401== the results in fig 5 and table 1 indicate that tnf potentiates the effects of hiv-prot1_155871  tat prot1_155871  for the induction of icam-1  vcam-1  and prot2_6401  elam prot2_6401 -1  ||9269771_155871_6401== to determine that adhesion molecules induced by hiv-prot1_155871  tat prot1_155871   tnf are involved in cellular adhesion  after treatment with either hiv-prot1_155871  tat prot1_155871   100 ng  ml   or tnf  100 ng  ml   for 6 hours  ec were treated with antibodies against either icam-1 or vcam-1 or prot2_6401  elam prot2_6401 -1 or a combination for 1 hour at room temperature and then examined for adhesion to hl-60 cells  ||9269771_155871_6401== in the present report  we examined the effect of hiv-prot1_155871  tat prot1_155871  protein on the ec surface expression of the adhesion molecules icam-1  vcam-1  and prot2_6401  elam prot2_6401 -1  ||9269771_155871_6401== like hiv-prot1_155871  tat prot1_155871   tnf interacts with human ec and causes the de novo synthesis of icam-1  vcam-1  and prot2_6401  elam prot2_6401 -1  ||9269771_155871_6401== 24 our current results indicate that exposure of ec to exogenous hiv-prot1_155871  tat prot1_155871  induces icam-1  vcam-1  and prot2_6401  elam prot2_6401 -1  ||9269771_155871_6401== hofman et al 31 showed an increase in expression of prot2_6401  elam prot2_6401 -1 by hiv-prot1_155871  tat prot1_155871  in human umbilical vein ec within 4 hours and its complete disappearance by 24 hours  ||9269771_155871_6401== it is not due to the lack of activity of hiv-prot1_155871  tat prot1_155871  protein  because it induced prot2_6401  elam prot2_6401 -1 in both the studies  ||9269771_155871_6401== our report is the first to indicate that  besides prot2_6401  elam prot2_6401 -1 and vcam-1  hiv-prot1_155871  tat prot1_155871  also induces icam-1
