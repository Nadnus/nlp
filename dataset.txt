Nup98 interaction is direct , that regions of yeast Crm1p other than those affected by the <PROT2_7514>  crm1 </PROT2_7514> mutations participate in Nup98 interaction , or that distinct cofactors mediate the Nup98 ? <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> NES interaction . ||14554087_155908_7514==>It has been argued , based on observations of the in vitro requirements of cofactors for the reactivity of the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> NES with the FXFG protein Nup42 , that the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> NES - RanGTP - <PROT2_7514>  CRM1 </PROT2_7514> ternary complex facilitates Nup42 interaction ( Floer and Blobel , 1999 ) . ||14554087_155908_7514==>Interestingly , a recent study suggests that the accumulation of <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> - bound RRE RNAs at the NPC is not inhibited by leptomycin B ( Cmarko et al. , 2002 ) , an inhibitor of the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> NES ? <PROT2_7514>  CRM1 </PROT2_7514> interaction ; this may be reflective of the potential for <PROT2_7514>  CRM1 </PROT2_7514> - independent association of the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> - bound RRE RNA cargo with inner NPC components , such as Nup98 , during the initial phase of nuclear export . ||9874563_155807_6908==>As shown in fig. 5 , FLAG - <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> was coimmunoprecipitated by anti - <PROT2_6908>  TFIID </PROT2_6908> ( <PROT2_6908>  TBP </PROT2_6908> ) , anti - TFIIB , or anti - GR antibodies in dexamethasone - treated cells , suggesting that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> binds to components of the transcription machinery and to the GR , as part of the glucocorticoid - activated transcription initiation complex ( 23 ) . ||9874563_155807_6908==>FLAG - VprL64A was coimmunoprecipitated by anti - TFIIB antibody , suggesting that the TFIIB - binding site of this mutant remains functional , whereas FLAG - <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> ( 36 - 96 ) was not precipitated by either GR , <PROT2_6908>  TFIID </PROT2_6908> , or TFIIB antibodies . ||9874563_155807_6908==>Binding to both factors leads to enhanced incorporation of <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> into a large transcription complex also including other transcription factors such as <PROT2_6908>  TFIID </PROT2_6908> . ||9874563_155807_6908==><PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> can be precipitated with anti - <PROT2_6908>  TFIID </PROT2_6908> ( <PROT2_6908>  TBP </PROT2_6908> ) , anti - TFIIB , or anti - hGR antibodies in dexamethasone - treated A204 cells . ||9874563_155807_6908==>Coprecipitation experiments ( fig. 5 ) showed that in the presence of glucocorticoid <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> became associated not only with the GR , but also with TFIIB and <PROT2_6908>  TFIID </PROT2_6908> , consistent with its incorporation into a stable transcription initiation complex , reminiscent of other nuclear receptor coactivators . ||9882380_155348_7374==>Using an in vitro protein - protein binding assay , we reveal a direct interaction between the precursor form of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> and the viral <PROT1_155348>  integrase </PROT1_155348> ( IN ) . ||9882380_155348_7374==>These results demonstrate that the absence of virion - associated <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> is directly related to the absence of the IN domain of the gag - pro - <PROT1_155348>  pol </PROT1_155348> precursor .

transfected cells , the <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> signal was distributed in a small number of regularly shaped nuclear bodies instead of in interchromatin granules and perichromatin fibrils . ||11090190_155908_6427==>The <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> - positive nuclear bodies were specific to <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop - expressing cells and were not detected in nontransfected cells or in cells transfected with wild - type <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> ( data not shown ) . ||11090190_155908_6427==>In addition , three -

containing nuclear structures became more numerous and smaller and resembled the pattern previously observed in MDCK cells treated with DRB ( 38 ) . ||11090190_155908_6427==>Effects of heat shock on the distribution of <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop and <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> . ||11090190_155908_6427==>This prompted us to compare how <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop and <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> would respond to heat shock . ||11090190_155908_6427==>Cells transfected with <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop were subjected to heat shock at 42�C for 10 , 20 , 30 , or 50 min and then analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using anti - sRev and anti - <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> antibodies . ||11090190_155908_6427==>Thus , <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop responded to heat shock in a manner more similar to that reported for snRNP antigens than that of <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> . ||11090190_155908_6427==>As shown in fig. 4 , <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> LoopBL accumulated primarily in the nucleus but was not detected in nuclear bodies ; <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> exhibited a normal intranuclear distribution in speckles and grains . ||11090190_155908_6427==>To determine whether <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop and <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> remained in the isolated nuclei after the extraction procedure , we carried out indirect immunofluorescence assays on both intact <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop - transfected cells and extracted nuclei prepared from duplicate transfections . ||11090190_155908_6427==>In contrast , <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> was readily detected in the extracted nuclei , primarily in the pattern characteristic of nontransfected cells , as well as in nuclear bodies in a few of the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop - positive nuclei , even though <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop was not detected in these structures ( data not shown ) . ||11090190_155908_6427==>The apparent differential release of <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> and <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop from the nucleus and nuclear bodies is in line with the results of the heat -

positive nuclear bodies were observed exclusively in cells expressing <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop , with untransfected cells showing the typical accumulation of <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> in speckles and grains ( fig. 2 ) . ||11090190_155908_6427==>Interestingly , HLtat cells treated for 3 h with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor DRB exhibited <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> - containing nuclear bodies that were morphologically indistinguishable from the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop - containing nuclear bodies ( fig. 3 ) as well as the <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> - positive nuclear structures observed in previous studies of - amanitin - treated cells . ||11090190_155908_6427==>It is tempting to speculate that the accumulation of <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> in nuclear bodies in cells expressing <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop reflects inhibition of transcription and / or splicing by the mutant due to inappropriate sequestration of transcription - processing factors , a possibility that is currently being tested . ||11090190_155908_6427==>Upon incubation for 11 h with the drug , <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> Loop was still detected mainly in the nuclei , but nuclear bodies were no longer evident ; staining with anti - <PROT2_6427>  SC35 </PROT2_6427> antibody confirmed the presence of nuclear speckles with a normal morphology in leptomycin B - treated cells ( data not shown ) . ||12600646_155459_7431==>Current research suggests an association of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> with the intermediate filament protein , <PROT2_7431>  vimentin </PROT2_7431> , and the tyrosine kinase , Hck , but the significance of these associations remains to be defined . ||12600646_155459_7431==>Given the association of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> with cytoskeletal proteins such as <PROT2_7431>  vimentin </PROT2_7431> , ( Khan et al. , 2001 ) also postulate that intra - virion <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> in association with the NP complex , acts upon entry into target cells as an adaptor to link the complex to a cellular transport pathway facilitating its transport to the nuclear membrane . ||12600646_155459_7431==>Earlier work suggested a connection between the cytoskeletal component <PROT2_7431>  vimentin </PROT2_7431> and <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> based on co - localisation of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> with <PROT2_7431>  vimentin </PROT2_7431> in HeLa cells ( Karczewski and Simon ) . ||12600646_155459_7431==>Since there is an association between <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> and Gag during viral assembly , it follows that an interaction of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> with cytoskeletal components , such as <PROT2_7431>  vimentin </PROT2_7431> , is consistent with its proposed function in viral assembly and proper formation of the reverse transcription complex . ||12600646_155459_7431==>However Simon et al. ( 1997 ) were unable to detect co - localisation of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> and <PROT2_7431>  vimentin </PROT2_7431> in non - permissive cells and further studies with <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> expression in Cos - 7 cells shows a dramatic effect on <PROT2_7431>  vimentin </PROT2_7431> localisation although <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> and <PROT2_7431>  vimentin </PROT2_7431> do not co - localise ( Henzler et al. , 2001 ) . ||12600646_155459_7431==>Thus the significance of the <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> ? <PROT2_7431>  vimentin </PROT2_7431> interaction remains unclear .

mediated <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> degradation , phosphorylation of the two casein kinase II sites in the cytoplasmic domain has been shown to be essential to this function and it happens to be the most conserved sequence in <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> proteins isolated from different subtypes of HIV - 1 ( Schubert et al 1994 , Paul and Jabbar 1997 and McCormick - Davis et al 2000a ) . ||12954211_155945_920==>Thus , <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> has a potential role in the pathogenesis of HIV - 1 and SHIV by promoting the degradation of <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> molecules in these complexes , allowing Env transport to the cell surface for assembly into viral particles . ||12954211_155945_920==>The importance of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> in the circulating <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> + T cell loss caused by SHIV was also demonstrated in a recent study of the entire <PROT1_155945>  vpu </PROT1_155945> coding sequence prior to env ( Stephens et al 2002 ) . ||12954211_155945_920==>In this report , we have analyzed the ability of the pathogenic molecular clone SHIV KU - 1bMC33 to cause rapid <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> + T cell loss and AIDS following site - directed changes that removed the two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domain of the <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> protein . ||12954211_155945_920==>We hypothesized that because of the importance of the casein kinase II sites to <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> degradation by <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> that the virus would be less pathogenic for macaques . ||12954211_155945_920==>These results indicate that the casein kinase II sites of the <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> protein are important to the massive <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> + T cell loss associated with infection with this virus . ||12954211_155945_920==>The obvious question that arose from the results of this study was `` Why did macaque CC8X develop severe <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> + T cell loss and die at 18 weeks postinoculation ? '' We hypothesized that the virus in this macaque may have selected for mutations in <PROT1_155945>  vpu </PROT1_155945> that might have resulted in the reversion of the glycines at positions 52 and 56 to serine residues or compensating amino acid substitutions in other proteins , such as Env . ||12954211_155945_920==>Taken together , the results of this study indicate for the first time that the phosphorylation of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> potentiates a dramatic loss in <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> + T cells following inoculation with pathogenic SHIV KU - 1bMC33 and provide additional evidence that this viral protein is important to the <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> + T cell loss in HIV - 1 - infected people . ||14561767_155945_920==>The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> protein acts as an adaptor for the proteasomal degradation of <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> by recruiting <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> and - transducin repeat - containing protein ( TrCP ) , the receptor component of the multisubunit SCF - TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex . ||14561767_155945_920==><PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> increases the release of virus particles from the plasma membrane ( 1 ) through its N -

81 ) . ||14561767_155945_920==>It was shown recently that <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> exerts a positive effect on HIV - 1 infectivity by down - modulating <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> receptor molecules at the surface of HIV - 1 - producing cells ( 3 ) . ||14561767_155945_920==><PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> degradation requires the phosphorylation of the serine residues at positions 52 and 56 of the <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> cytoplasmic domain by casein kinase II ( 4 ) and the binding of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> to <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> trapped in the ER via the formation of a complex with the HIV -

TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex , and connects <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> to the ubiquitin - proteasome machinery . ||14561767_155945_920==>Besides serving as an adaptor for <PROT2_920>  CD4 </PROT2_920> degradation , <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> is a strong competitor that can inhibit the degradation of the TrCP substrates , leading them to accumulate in HIV - 1 - producing cells expressing <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> . ||14561767_155945_920==>As - catenin accumulates in HIV - 1 - producing cells expressing <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> , and given that the thymus is one of the major targets of the HIV -

B activation ( fig. 3 B , lanes 1 and 2 ) , while cotransfection of the two plasmids resulted in a strong synergistic effect ( lane 3 ) , similar to the one obtained by serum addition ( lane 4 ) . ||10400814_155871_5610==>The above results clearly indicate that <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> is involved in <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> - induced activation of NF - B in mouse cells . ||10400814_155871_5610==>For this purpose , we studied the role of <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> and <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> in the activation of transcription from a transfected LTR - CAT cassette in mouse cells lacking a functional <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> as well as in control NIH 3T3 cells . ||10400814_155871_5610==>Under these conditions , <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> considerably enhances the transcription driven by the LTR in NIH 3T3 cells , while <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> does not have any effect ( fig. 4 A ) . ||10400814_155871_5610==>In <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> knockout cells ( fig. 4 B ) the transcriptional effect of <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> is impaired with respect to control cells , but it can be fully restored by cotransfection of a wild - type <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> expression plasmid . ||10400814_155871_5610==><PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> is functionally required for <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> transactivation of the LTR promoter in mouse fibroblasts . ||10400814_155871_5610==>Five micrograms of <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> 101 and / or 5 �g of <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> expression constructs was cotransfected , as indicated . ||10400814_155871_5610==>Altogether , the data described above demonstrate that the functions of <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> are required for NF - B nuclear translocation and LTR transcription activation by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> in a murine system . ||10400814_155871_5610==>In all these cell lines , the <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> dominant - negative mutant caused a net decrease in <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> - mediated activation of LTR - driven transcription ( fig. 5 A , B , and C ) . ||10400814_155871_5610==>Dominant - negative <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> impairs LTR activation induced by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> . ||10400814_155871_5610==>HL3T1 , BF24 , and Jurkat cells ( panels A , B , and C , respectively ) were transfected with 2.5 �g of pCDNAIII empty vector ( first lanes of each panel ) or with 500 ng of <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> 101 expression vector and 2 �g of the dominant -

negative construct on <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> transactivation was mediated in cis by the enhancer region of the LTR . ||10400814_155871_5610==>As shown in fig. 6 , when the vector expressing <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> 101 was cotransfected in HeLa cells together with the <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> dominant - negative construct , transactivation from the wild - type LTR was reduced , while it was unaffected from an LTR promoter bearing the deletion of the NF - B sites ( 30 ) . ||10400814_155871_5610==>An intact LTR enhancer region is required for downregulation of <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> transactivation by dominant - negative <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> . ||10400814_155871_5610==>Altogether the experimental data reported above indicate that <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> is involved in <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> transactivation of the LTR both in rodent and in human cells through the activation of NF - B . ||10400814_155871_5610==>Following different experimental strategies , over the last few years , several laboratories have suggested that a complex interplay exists between <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> , TAR , and <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> , although the results obtained have often been controversial . ||10400814_155871_5610==>Also controversial are the findings that the levels and the activity of <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> are decreased ( 38 ) , increased ( 15 ) , or unaffected ( 34 ) in HIV - 1 - infected and in <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> - expressing cells . ||10400814_155871_5610==>As far as <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> and <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> are concerned , two independent laboratories have recently shown that a physical interaction exists between the two proteins both in vitro and in vivo and that this interaction requires the integrity of the basic domain of <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> ( 12 , 34 ) . ||10400814_155871_5610==>However , it should be pointed out that the same laboratories have indicated , by in vitro studies , that <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> behaves as an inhibitor of <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> activation and as a competitive substrate for phosphorylation , in apparent contradiction with the functional positive role of the <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> - <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> interplay that we are suggesting here . ||10400814_155871_5610==>In this respect , we believe that the conditions for in vitro functional studies of the kinase are likely to be considerably different from those found within the cells , where the relative concentrations of <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> , TAR , <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> , and accessory factors are not easily quantifiable and might vary during the course of infection . ||10400814_155871_5610==>As an alternative explanation , we can not rule out the possibility that the functional requirement of <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> for <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> - mediated NF - B activation , which clearly stems from the set of our experiments , is not directly dependent on the <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> - <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> protein - protein interaction but is mediated by an unidentified intermediate pathway . ||10400814_155871_5610==>The results presented in this work suggest that both <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> 101 , <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> 86 , and <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> 72 ( one exon ; results not shown ) are able to activate NF - B through the <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> pathway , both in rodent and human cells , and that this pathway requires the integrity of the basic domain of the protein . ||10400814_155871_5610==>While it is difficult to rank the relative importance of these mechanisms , we would like to point out that in murine fibroblasts lacking <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> the induction of NF - B nuclear translocation by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> is almost completely impaired , thus suggesting that , at least in this cell type , the presence of functional <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> is likely to be crucial for this function . ||10400814_155871_5610==>Jeang for the initial suggestion to investigate the role of the <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> - <PROT2_5610>  PKR </PROT2_5610> interaction in NF - B induction . ||11956210_155871_2648==>We and others have recently shown that <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> is directly acetylated at lysine 28 , within the activation domain , and lysine 50 , in the TAR RNA binding domain , by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> - associated histone acetyltransferases p300 , p300 / CBP - associating factor , and <PROT2_2648>  hGCN5 </PROT2_2648> . ||11956210_155871_2648==>The other class of <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> co -

type <PROT2_983>  cdc2 </PROT2_983> strain has an 8.2�0.9 % colony forming ability so <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> kills Y15F cells at least as efficiently as wild - type <PROT2_983>  cdc2 </PROT2_983> cells even though <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> can not induce G2 arrest in the Y15F strain . ||10958988_155807_983==>Under <PROT1_155807>  vpr </PROT1_155807> - repressing conditions , Y15F cells show the normal pattern of intense staining of the septa and weaker uniform staining of growing cell walls and have the short , nearly spherical , cells due to the premature mitosis caused by the overactive Y15F <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> kinase ( fig. 3 A , left panel ) ( Gould and Nurse , 1989 ) . ||10958988_155807_983==>There was an unusually heavy streak of the <PROT2_983>  cdc2 </PROT2_983> + H78R strain on the <PROT1_155807>  vpr </PROT1_155807> - on plate which gives the appearance of a small amount of growth , but this was not seen on repetitions of this experiment . ||10958988_155807_983==>Mutations in <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> affect cell death similarly in wild - type and Y15F <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> strains ||10958988_155807_983==>Point mutations in <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> can affect the G2 arrest and cell killing activities of <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> differently when tested in a wild - type <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> yeast strain ( Chen et al. , 1999 ) . ||10958988_155807_983==>Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry of the Y15F <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> strain carrying the <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> point mutations showed patterns similar to Cdc2F15Y in fig. 1 C ( data not shown ) indicating that the <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> mutations did not induce G2 arrest in this strain just as was seen for wild - type <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> . ||10958988_155807_983==>These four mutant <PROT1_155807>  vpr </PROT1_155807> genes were then compared for their ability to kill yeast cells with either a wild - type or a Y15F <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> kinase as a further test of the relationship between G2 arrest and cell killing . ||10958988_155807_983==>Thus , identical patterns of cell killing were seen for the <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> mutations in the wild - type ( <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> + ) and Y15F <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> strains in this qualitative experiment . ||10958988_155807_983==>In both the wild - type ( <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> + ) and the Y15F <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> strains , the F34I mutation showed reduced cell killing , E25K / N28D showed a slight reduction in cell killing , and the H78R and R88K mutations killed cells nearly as efficiently as the wild - type <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> ( Chen et al. , 1999 ) . ||10958988_155807_983==>The results presented here are direct evidence that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> induces G2 arrest in fission yeast exclusively by increasing the phosphorylation of Tyr15 on <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> . ||10958988_155807_983==>Consistent with the effects of these mutations , <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> expression causes hyperphosphorylation of <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> and decreased kinase activity ( fig. 1 A ? B ; Zhao et al. , 1996 ) . ||10958988_155807_983==>These results all support the conclusion that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> induces G2 arrest in fission yeast solely by increasing the phosphorylation levels of Tyr15 on <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> . ||10958988_155807_983==>Thus , <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> induces G2 arrest by increasing the levels of inhibitory phosphorylations on <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> both in human and fission yeast cells . ||10958988_155807_983==>G2 arrest induced by <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> resembles that induced by DNA damage in that both proceed through the phosphorylation of Tyr15 on <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> ( Nurse , 1997 ) . ||10958988_155807_983==>The Y15F <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> strain and <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> point mutations indicate that G2 arrest is not required for cell killing and morphological changes . ||10958988_155807_983==>In the Y15F <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> strain where there is no induction of G2 arrest , <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> still induces cell killing and morphological changes . ||10958988_155807_983==>Studies of twelve <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> point mutations , previously examined in human cells ( Selig et al. , 1997 ) , showed that the mutations often had opposite effects on G2 arrest and cell killing in wild - type <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> fission yeast ( Chen et al. , 1999 ) . ||10958988_155807_983==>Thus , even when G2 arrest was reduced or eliminated both by the H78R or R88K mutation in <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> and by the Y15F <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> yeast mutation , <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> still kills the yeast cells . ||10958988_155807_983==>This failure to induce G2 arrest is expected since the mechanism by which <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> induces G2 arrest , increased Tyr phosphorylation of Cdc28 / <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> , does not lead to G2 arrest in budding yeast . ||10958988_155807_983==>This study demonstrates another similarity in that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> induces G2 arrest both in human and fission yeast cells through inhibitory phosphorylation of <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> . ||11531413_155807_983==>Viral protein R ( <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> ) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 induces G2 arrest in cells from distantly related eukaryotes including human and fission yeast through inhibitory phosphorylation of tyrosine 15 ( Tyr15 ) on <PROT2_983>  Cdc2 </PROT2_983> . ||11531413_155807_995==>ScienceDirect -

induced G2 arrest comes from a genetic screen , which identified genes whose overexpression affects <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - induced G2 arrest . ||11531413_155807_995==>Overexpression of the wos2 gene , an inhibitor of Wee1 , suppresses <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> -

cycle progression from G2 to mitosis ( M ) . ||12110603_155807_983==>The <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> protein of primate lentiviruses arrests cell cycling at the G 2 / M phase through an inactivation of cyclin B�p34 <PROT2_983>  cdc2 </PROT2_983> and its upstream regulator cdc25 . ||12110603_155807_995==>The <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> protein of primate lentiviruses arrests cell cycling at the G 2 / M phase through an inactivation of cyclin B�p34 cdc2 and its upstream regulator <PROT2_995>  cdc25 </PROT2_995> . ||12110603_155807_995==>We provide here biochemical and functional evidence demonstrating that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> mediates G 2 arrest by forming a complex with protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) , an upstream regulator of <PROT2_995>  cdc25 </PROT2_995> . ||12110603_155807_995==>Interestingly , we found that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> association with B55 - containing PP2A targets the enzymatic complex to the nucleus and , importantly , enhances the recruitment and dephosphorylation of the <PROT2_995>  cdc25 </PROT2_995> substrate . ||12110603_155807_995==>Our data suggest that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> mediates G 2 arrest by enhancing the nuclear import of PP2A and by positively modulating its catalytic activity towards active phosphorylated nuclear <PROT2_995>  cdc25 </PROT2_995> . 

incorporates=====11932435_155030_3308==>Of the HIV - 1 genes , <PROT1_155030>  gag </PROT1_155030> was found to be sufficient for <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> incorporation , though <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> was roughly equimolar with pol - encoded proteins in virions . ||11932435_155030_3308==>To check whether VLPs formed by HIV - 1 <PROT1_155030>  Gag </PROT1_155030> incorporate <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> in the absence of other viral proteins , we PCR amplified and cloned a previously described <PROT1_155030>  gag </PROT1_155030> cDNA ( that was modified to be Rev independent ) ( 31 ) into mammalian expression vector pEF / myc / cyto ( Invitrogen ) such that it was in - frame with a myc tag at the carboxyl terminus . ||11932435_155030_3308==>Since MLV does not incorporate <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> , we also cloned MLV <PROT1_155030>  gag </PROT1_155030> into the same expression vector as a negative control . ||11932435_155030_3308==>We found that HIV - 1 <PROT1_155030>  Gag </PROT1_155030> is sufficient for the incorporation of <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> ( fig. 4C , lane 1 ) . ||11932435_155030_3308==>Even though MLV <PROT1_155030>  Gag </PROT1_155030> is well expressed and forms VLPs just as efficiently as HIV - 1 <PROT1_155030>  Gag </PROT1_155030> , it does not incorporate <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> ( fig. 4C , lane 2 ) , consistent with the fact that infectious MLV virions do not incorporate <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> ( fig. 3C ) . ||11932435_155030_3308==><PROT1_155030>  Gag </PROT1_155030> is sufficient for <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> incorporation into HIV - 1 virions . ||11932435_155030_3308==>Both the stress - inducible protein <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> and its constitutive form , Hsc70 , interact with various viral proteins and may be involved in the assembly of adenovirus ( 21 ) , enterovirus ( 22 ) , and polyomavirus <PROT1_155030>  capsid </PROT1_155030> protein complexes ( 8 ) . ||11932435_155030_3308==>Hence , <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> and Hsc70 could bind to nascent HIV - 1 <PROT1_155030>  Gag </PROT1_155030> polyprotein chains and hold them in an assembly - competent conformation during transport to the plasma membrane . ||11932435_155030_3308==>For example , <PROT2_3308>  Hsp70 </PROT2_3308> might actively uncoat the viral <PROT1_155030>  capsid </PROT1_155030> in a manner similar to its role in the uncoating of clathrin cages ( 6 ) . ||11932435_155030_3329==>Type D retrovirus <PROT1_155030>  Gag </PROT1_155030> polyprotein interacts with the cytosolic <PROT2_3329>  chaperonin </PROT2_3329> TRiC . ||12670953_10309_155348==>In some cases host proteins , such as the <PROT2_155348>  integrase </PROT2_155348> inhibitor 1 ( Ini1 ) factor or the uracil DNA glycosylase ( <PROT1_10309>  UNG2 </PROT1_10309> ) enzyme , interact with IN and are specifically incorporated into viral particles ( 21 , 22 ) . ||12670953_10309_155348==>These data indicate that IN promoted <PROT1_10309>  UNG2 </PROT1_10309> packaging in the context of the Gag - <PROT2_155348>  Pol </PROT2_155348> polyprotein but not in the context of a Vpr�IN fusion . ||12670953_10309_155348==>In trans - complementation assays , we observed that host <PROT1_10309>  UNG2 </PROT1_10309> could not be packaged by the Vpr�IN fusion despite being clearly dependent on the presence of IN in the context of the Gag - <PROT2_155348>  Pol </PROT2_155348> precursor . ||12670953_10309_155348==>First , the folding of IN processed from the Vpr fusion protein may not accurately reflect the folding of IN processed from the Gag - <PROT2_155348>  Pol </PROT2_155348> precursor , leading to differential bindings of <PROT1_10309>  UNG2 </PROT1_10309> . ||12670953_10309_155348==>Second , although the IN domain of the Gag - <PROT2_155348>  Pol </PROT2_155348> precursor is required for <PROT1_10309>  UNG2 </PROT1_10309> packaging , it may not be sufficient . ||12670953_10309_155348==>It may be that a triple interaction between <PROT1_10309>  UNG2 </PROT1_10309> and both the reverse transcriptase and IN domains of the Gag - <PROT2_155348>  Pol </PROT2_155348> precursor is necessary to allow the efficient packaging of <PROT1_10309>  UNG2 </PROT1_10309> . ||12670953_10309_155348==>We have not been able to draw definite conclusions about the importance of <PROT1_10309>  UNG2 </PROT1_10309> for HIV - 1 replication , but we have found an interesting mutant of IN that could be rescued by allowing a higher concentration of the very same mutant <PROT2_155348>  integrase </PROT2_155348> in the viral particle . ||12670953_10309_155348==>1 The abbreviations used are : HIV -

type virions or into <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - deficient HIV - 1 virions , indicating that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> is not involved in <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> packaging . ||9882380_155807_7374==>We have previously reported , in a study using the yeast two - hybrid system , that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> binds to the DNA repair enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase ( <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> ) ( 4 ) . ||9882380_155807_7374==>There exists therefore the possibility that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - associated <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> of primate lentiviruses and dUTPase of nonprimate lentiviruses have similar roles in virus replication . ||9882380_155807_7374==>It is therefore of interest to address whether <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> is incorporated into viral particles and whether the requirement for <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> is related to such a localization . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Packaging of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into viral particles is independent of the presence of <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>To investigate the incorporation of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into virions and to test whether <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> is required in this process , we used wild - type NDK and <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> mutant NDK virions derived from the productively infected H9 T - cell line . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Unexpectedly , we observed that gradient fractions from <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> mutant virions also contain <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> ( fig. 1 b , right panel ) . ||9882380_155807_7374==><PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> was also detected in both wild -

associated protein and that the incorporation of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into viral particles may not depend on the presence of packaged <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Packaging of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into viral particles is independent of the presence of <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Our above results indicating that <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> is packaged within virions through a <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - independent mechanism led us to investigate which viral protein is required to incorporate <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into viral particles . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Individual gradient fractions were then ultracentrifuged and analyzed by Western blotting with anti - p24 , anti - <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> , and anti - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> antibody ( fig. 2 ) . ||9882380_155807_7374==>As a control , Pr55 Gag and <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> overexpressed in cell lysate are shown , as well as endogenous expression of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>We failed to detect the presence of incorporated <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> in gradient fractions containing both Pr55 Gag and <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> , however . ||9882380_155807_7374==>These results indicate that the gag gene products are probably not important for the incorporation of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> within virions and confirm that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> is not required in this event . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Packaging of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into viral particles is independent of the presence of Pr55 Gag and <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Cell - free supernatant containing virus - like particles was subjected to a linear sucrose density gradient , and individual gradient fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of Pr55 Gag and <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> , as well as for the presence of packaged <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>As a control , HeLa cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of Pr55 Gag , <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> , and endogenous <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>The cDNA encoding the complete <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> protein ( residues 1 to 304 ) was amplified with appropriate primers by PCR from clone <PROT1_155807>  p15 </PROT1_155807> ( 25 ) , kindly provided by G . ||9882380_155807_7374==>GST , GST - <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> , and GST - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> ( 52 - 304 ) fusion proteins were prepared as previously described ( 4 ) . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Cell lysate overexpressing <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> was incubated with equivalent amounts of GST , GST - IN , or GST - <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> , and bound proteins were revealed by Western blotting with an anti - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> antibody ( fig. 3 b ) . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Binding analysis indicated that the precursor form of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> preferentially associates with GST - IN , while the two forms of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> associate with GST - <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>( a ) Cell lysate overexpressing IN was incubated with equivalent amounts of GST , GST - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> ( 1 - 304 ) , GST - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> ( 52 - 304 ) , or GST - <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> fusion proteins affinity purified on GSH - agarose beads . ||9882380_155807_7374==>( b ) Cell lysate overexpressing <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> was incubated with equivalent amounts of GST , GST - IN , or GST - <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> fusion proteins affinity purified on GSH - agarose beads , and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> antibody . ||9882380_155807_7374==>To demonstrate unequivocally that the IN domain is required for the incorporation of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into virions , and that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> is not involved in this process , we investigated whether IN mutant viruses or IN - <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> double mutant viruses are impaired in incorporation of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into viral particles . ||9882380_155807_7374==>As expected , the incorporation of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into viral particles was observed when wild - type as well as <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - defective viruses were analyzed . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Interestingly , viruses defective for the presence of IN but still expressing <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> in viral particles did not incorporate detectable amounts of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>A similar defect in <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> incorporation into virions was observed when viruses used in the experiments were defective in both IN and <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> proteins . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Altogether , our data indicate that the IN domain is sufficient for packaging of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> into virions and that <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> is not involved in this process . ||9882380_155807_7374==>When virions ( wild type , <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> defective , IN defective , or <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - IN defective ) corresponding to 3 � 10 6 cpm of reverse transcriptase activity were incubated with the uracil - containing substrate , no <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> activity was detected , although the presence of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> protein is detectable in wild - type and <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - defective virions . ||9882380_155807_7374==>We initially reported that <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> has the ability to bind <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> ( 4 ) . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Although <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> is incorporated into viral particles , the question arises as to why the intravirion packaging of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> is not related to the presence of <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> in virions but to the presence of IN . ||9882380_155807_7374==>It is possible that during assembly and budding , the interaction between <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> and NCp7 impairs the binding of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> to <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> via steric hindrance . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Experiments to test whether <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> , <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> , and NCp7 can associate as a trimeric complex would resolve this issue . ||9882380_155807_7374==>The other explanation invokes the idea that <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> could bind alternatively <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> or IN depending on its maturation status . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Consistent with this , our in vivo and in vitro data indicate that IN has the ability to bind the cytoplasmic precursor form of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> ( this study ) , while <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> has the ability to bind preferentially the mature form of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> , as we previously reported with coimmunoprecipitation experiments ( 4 ) . ||9882380_155807_7374==>It is noteworthy that residues 1 to 52 of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> are important for binding of IN ( this study ) , while residues 222 to 225 have been reported to be important for binding of <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> ( 5 ) . ||9882380_155807_7374==>We speculate that the pre - mature form of <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> is cleaved after entry in new cells , and then the mature form may interact with <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> . ||9882380_155807_7374==>The fact that HIV - 1 viruses have evolved by elaborating two viral proteins , IN and <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> , which both have the ability to bind <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> argues for the importance of these interactions during the viral life cycle . ||9882380_155807_7374==>What then are the respective roles , during the viral life cycle , of the <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> and IN - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> interactions ? We have previously proposed that the <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> interaction might play a role similar to that played by the dUTPases of nonprimate lentiviruses , i.e. , the reduction of uracil misincorporation into newly synthesized viral DNA in order to avoid G - to - A substitutions ( 4 ) . ||9882380_155807_7374==>Therefore , one possibility is that the <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> and / or IN - <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> interactions participate in the nuclear import of the viral PIC . ||9882380_155807_7374==>It would thus be interesting to determine whether <PROT2_7374>  UDG </PROT2_7374> can be found , through its association with <PROT1_155807>  Vpr </PROT1_155807> and / or IN , to be an integral part of the PIC .

induced NF - B activity . ||10393859_155871_4843==>To determine how NO is induced by HIV <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> , reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to demonstrate the induction of <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> -

induced NF - B activation , we determined the level of NF - B induction by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> in macrophages from both wild - type and <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 2 gene knockout mice . ||10393859_155871_4843==>In <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 2 gene knockout macrophages , <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> induced a sustained activation of NF - B , whereas the NO induction by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> was marginal . ||10393859_155871_4843==>A : Luciferase reporter assay of RAW264.7 cells co -

PCR assays were performed to evaluate the induction of <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 2 and <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 3 mRNA by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> . ||10393859_155871_4843==>As indicated in Figure 7 , both <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 2 and <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 3 are induced in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> transfection . ||10393859_155871_4843==>We have also observed the induction of <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 2 and <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 3 mRNA by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> in phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) - primed Jurkat T cells and in the THP - 1 human monocyte cell line as well ( data not shown ) . ||10393859_155871_4843==>It has been suggested that <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> induced <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 2 mRNA expression through the activation of NF - B , as this nuclear transcription factor plays a crucial role in the transcription of <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 2 . ||10393859_155871_4843==><PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> induces <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> -

transfected cells in the absence or presence of <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> inhibitor L - NMMA for 6 or 18 hours . ||10393859_155871_4843==>The results in Figure 10 provide further insight into which of the candidate response elements in the proximal 100 - bp promoter region are functional or nonfunctional in regulating expression of <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 3 gene by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> . ||10393859_155871_4843==>These results demonstrate that the Sp - 1 sites in this proximal region are necessary for the induction of <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 3 gene expression by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> . ||10393859_155871_4843==>The role of the putative NF - B site in the induction of <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 3 by <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> , however , appears less important due to the binding of p50 / p50 homodimer , but not p50 / p65 heterodimer , at this site . ||10393859_155871_4843==>CAT activity assay of RAW264.7 cells transfected with a plasmid containing wild -

2 and <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 3 mRNA synthesis and hence increase NO production . ||10393859_155871_4843==>To that end , our results provide suggestive evidence that <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> can indeed induce <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 2 and <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> - 3 mRNA expression . ||10393859_155871_4843==>These findings are supported by those of Hayman et al who demonstrated the neutralizing effect of a <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> inhibitor on the neurotoxicity of synthetic <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> protein . ||10393859_155871_4843==>It is not surprising therefore that <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> can also promotes <PROT2_4843>  NOS </PROT2_4843> -

<PROT1_155871>  tat </PROT1_155871> but not that of the CAT gene as RSV - CAT in U373MG astroglial cells led to the induction of NO production and the expression of <PROT2_4843>  iNOS </PROT2_4843> protein and mRNA . ||12167619_155871_4843==>The induction of human <PROT2_4843>  iNOS </PROT2_4843> promoter - derived luciferase activity by the expression of RSV - <PROT1_155871>  tat </PROT1_155871> suggests that RSV - <PROT1_155871>  tat </PROT1_155871> induces the transcription of <PROT2_4843>  iNOS </PROT2_4843> . ||12167619_155871_4843==>Activation of NF -

- The presence of NF - B DNA - binding sites in the promoter of <PROT2_4843>  iNOS </PROT2_4843> ( 34 - 36 ) and the inhibition of expression of <PROT2_4843>  iNOS </PROT2_4843> by the inhibitors of NF -

1 / <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virions occurs with normal kinetics ( fig. 6 ) and generates normal mature Gag proteins ( fig. 3 to 6 ) is in agreement with a number of steady - state analyses ( 9 , 17 , 22 , 39 , 44 , 47 ) and a previous kinetic analysis ( 39 ) but stands opposed to several other reports of aberrant <PROT2_5718>  p55 </PROT2_5718> Gag processing ( 6 , 56 ) . ||12719574_155459_5718==>The reason for this discrepancy is not immediately obvious , but the weight of evidence now disfavors the idea that the absence of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> results in reduced <PROT2_5718>  p55 </PROT2_5718> Gag processing . ||12719574_155459_5718==><PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> and the <PROT2_5718>  p55 </PROT2_5718> Gag polyprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 are present in colocalizing membrane -

hNup98 interaction offer new insights into the properties of this intriguing nucleoporin and argue persuasively in support of a physiological role for <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> in <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> - mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport of RRE - containing HIV RNAs , as previously proposed ( Zolotukhin and Felber , 1999 ) . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Thus , an initial high - affinity interaction with <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> may target the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> exportasome to the inner NPC ; subsequently , a series of variable affinity interactions ( including relatively lower affinity interactions such as with Rab / hRIP ) may serve to propel the export complex through the NPC . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Interestingly , recent studies suggest that <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> is a mobile nucleoporin , moving between the nuclear interior and the NPC as well as between the nucleus and the cytoplasm ( Griffis et al. , 2002 ) ; this observation raises the possibility that the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> ? <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> complex alone may display potential , albeit limited , for RRE RNA export . ||14554087_155908_4928==>However , our recent studies indicate that a <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> 1 ? 116 ( M10 ) ? <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> fusion protein is incapable of promoting RRE RNA export under conditions where a <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> 1 ? 116 ( M10 ) ? CRM1 fusion protein mediates efficient nuclear export of such RNAs ( l. Li and L.K . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Despite the high degree of homology ( ~50 % ) in the amino acid sequences of the CRM1 proteins of s. cerevisiae and man , we observed that missense crm1 mutations in yeast that strongly abrogated the Rab / hRIP ? <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> NES interaction effected only a marginal reduction in the extent of <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> interaction with <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> or the kinesin - like cofactor REBP . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Explanations for this observation include possibilities that the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> ? <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> interaction is direct , that regions of yeast Crm1p other than those affected by the crm1 mutations participate in <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> interaction , or that distinct cofactors mediate the <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> ? <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> NES interaction . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Therefore , the interaction of the GLFG - repeat nucleoporin <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> , unlike that of the XXFG - repeat containing Rab / hRIP , with the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> NES may also involve the coordinate action of other cofactors in the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> multiprotein export complex . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Interestingly , a recent study suggests that the accumulation of <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> - bound RRE RNAs at the NPC is not inhibited by leptomycin B ( Cmarko et al. , 2002 ) , an inhibitor of the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> NES ? CRM1 interaction ; this may be reflective of the potential for CRM1 - independent association of the <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> - bound RRE RNA cargo with inner NPC components , such as <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> , during the initial phase of nuclear export . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Since the GLFG region can not localize at the nuclear envelope , this inhibition is probably reflective of intranuclear sequestration of <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> ? RRE RNA complexes at subnuclear sites by inappropriately localized GLFG region ( or wt <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> ) protein upon high - level overexpression . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Whether this region plays an important role in <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> transport , other than ensuring appropriate <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> localization , remains to be determined . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Interestingly , when exogenous wt <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> was expressed at lower levels , as in HeLa cells , significant increase of <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> - dependent RRE RNA export was detectable . ||14554087_155908_4928==>A likely explanation for the discrepancy in the observed effects of exogenously introduced wt <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> on <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> - dependent unspliced RNA export in 293T ( which supports expression vector replication ) versus HeLa ( wherein the expression vector can not replicate ) cells is the propensity of highly overexpressed exogenous <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> ( in 293T cells ) to localize predominantly in intranuclear , and perhaps inappropriate , structures rather than at the nuclear envelope ; in contrast , lower level overexpression of wt <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> , as in HeLa cells , results in primarily nuclear envelope localization of the exogenous protein . ||14554087_155908_4928==>Another intriguing observation is the failure of wt as well as FG - repeat containing mutant <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> proteins to suppress spliced ( <PROT1_155908>  Rev </PROT1_155908> - expressing ) RNA export in 293T cells in these experiments despite the demonstrated involvement of <PROT2_4928>  Nup98 </PROT2_4928> in export of spliced cellular mRNAs through the TAP - p15 pathway ( Reed and Hurt , 2002 ) . ||9054383_155871_2071==>Proteins were resolved on an SDS - polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel , blotted onto a nitrocellulose matrix ( Hybond C , Amersham ) , and analyzed with the appropriate antibodies using standard techniques ( anti - TBP , Promega ;

depleted extracts ( fig. 7 ) . ||9334325_1025_155871==>When <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> - depleted extract was used , the majority of the stimulatory effect of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> was abolished . ||9334325_1025_155871==>This suggests that other required factors were removed by the depletion of <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> or that Drosophila P -

TEFb and associates with the activation domain of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> . ||9334326_1025_155871==>To assess more directly the requirement of P - TEFb in <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> activation , we immunodepleted nuclear extracts with either antibodies to <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> or a control antibody and measured the ability of the treated extracts to support <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transactivation in vitro . ||9334326_1025_155871==>In contrast , the extract depleted with antibodies against <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> did not restore transactivation by <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> , suggesting that human P -

purified P - TEFb fraction to transcription reactions that contained anti - <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> - depleted nuclear extracts restored both <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - responsiveness and DRB sensitivity ( fig. 5 C , lanes 13 -

type or mutated <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> on <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - independent and <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - dependent transcriptional activation in the transfected cells . ||9334326_1025_155871==>Neither the wild - type nor the mutant <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> derivative affected <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - independent transcription from the HIV LTR ( fig. 6 A , B ) . ||9334326_1025_155871==>Interestingly , expression of the wild - type <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> , but not the kinase mutant consistently enhanced <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - dependent transcription in both cell types ( fig. 6 A , B ) , suggesting that recruitment of P - TEFb kinase to the HIV LTR is dependent on <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> . ||9334326_1025_155871==>More importantly , <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - dependent luciferase activity was inhibited on overexpression of mutant <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> in Jurkat and HeLa cells ( fig. 6 A , B ) . ||9334326_1025_155871==>Inhibition of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - dependent luciferase activity by mutant <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> was observed only under conditions that supported robust <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transactivation . ||9334326_1025_155871==>Jurkat cells supported the strongest <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - dependent activation ( > 2500 - fold ) and the most dramatic inhibition of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - mediated transcription by the mutant <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> kinase ( fig. 6 A ) . ||9334326_1025_155871==>HeLa cells supported intermediate levels of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transactivation ( an average of 50 - fold ) , which were inhibited consistently ~40 % by the mutant <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> kinase . ||9334326_1025_155871==>( A ) Inhibition of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - dependent transactivation by overexpression of mutated <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> in Jurkat cells . ||9334326_1025_155871==>All transfections were performed with a wild -

dependent activation in HeLa cells by wild - type , but not mutated <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> . ||9334326_1025_155871==>Therefore , the loss of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transactivation on treatment of the extract with antibodies to <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> implies that cofactors required for <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> function were removed by the immunodepletion process . ||9334326_1025_155871==>Direct evidence of a role for P - TEFb in <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> activation in vivo is provided by transient transfection experiments in Jurkat and HeLa cells with either the wild - type <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> subunit or one containing a null mutation ( fig. 6 ) . ||9334326_1025_155871==><PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - independent transcription from the HIV LTR was equivalent whether or not the <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> gene carried the null mutation . ||9334326_1025_155871==>In the presence of the wild -

1 LTR expression . ||9557739_1025_155871==>These results indicate that a <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> - containing complex mediates transactivation by <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> and suggest that <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> proteins function by localizing such a <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> - containing complex to the site of the transcribing provirus . ||9557739_1025_155871==>Based on biochemical observations , a number of cofactors that could constitute the cellular interface to <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> function have been proposed , including cellular general transcription factor TFIIH ( 11 , 31 ) , <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> -

type overexpressed <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> to squelch <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> function suggests that <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> function requires one or more subunits in addition to <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> , such that overexpression of one subunit disrupts the stoichiometry of the functional complex . ||9557739_1025_155871==>The observation that D167N squelches <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> function more efficiently than does wild - type <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> suggests that the catalytic function of <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> is important for <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> function and is consistent with our previously proposed model that the function of <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> during HIV transcription is to phosphorylate the CTD of RNAPII ( 15 ) . ||9557739_1025_155871==>To determine whether <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> overexpression could inhibit <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> activation of an integrated HIV - 1 LTR , we examined Jurkat T - cell line 1G5 , which contains an integrated HIV - 1 LTR with luciferase as the reporter protein ( 1 ) . ||9557739_1025_155871==>1G5 cells were cotransfected by electroporation with a <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - 1 expression plasmid and a <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> or D167N expression plasmid ( fig. 3 ) . ||9557739_1025_155871==>Measurement of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - induced luciferase activities at 24 h posttransfection yielded 60.1 luciferase U in the presence of the parental vector , 18.4 U upon wild - type <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> overexpression , and 7.8 U upon D167N overexpression . ||9557739_1025_155871==>Therefore , in 1G5 cells , <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> overexpression inhibited <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - induced luciferase expression 3.3 - fold , while D167N overexpression inhibited <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - induced luciferase expression 7.7 - fold . ||9557739_1025_155871==><PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> overexpression inhibits <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> activation of an integrated HIV - 1 LTR . ||9557739_1025_155871==>1G5 cells ( 3.0 � 10 6 ) were transfected with 1 �g of a CMV2 - FLAG - <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - 1 and 10 �g of a CMV2 - FLAG or FLAG - <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> plasmid by electroporation ( Gene Pulser ; Bio - Rad ) at 250 V and 960 �F in 400 �l of serum - free RPMI medium . ||9557739_1025_155871==>Both wild - type <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> and D167N squelch <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - mediated transactivation , and D167N squelches more efficiently than wild - type <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> . ||9557739_1025_155871==>These results obtained with 1G5 cells indicate , additionally , that <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> overexpression can squelch <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - 1 - mediated transactivation of an integrated HIV - 1 LTR . ||9557739_1025_155871==>Our observation that <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> associates with <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> led us to suggest the model for the mechanism of action of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> shown in fig. 4 A . ||9557739_1025_155871==>This model proposes that by binding to TAR RNA , <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> is able to functionally recruit <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> to the RNAPII complex , leading to hyperphosphorylation of the CTD and a resultant activation of transcription ( 15 ) . ||9557739_1025_155871==>This model proposes that <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> recruits a cellular protein kinase , <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> , to the RNAPII holoenzyme ( 15 ) . ||9557739_1025_155871==>In an additional experiment , we compared activation of the reporter plasmid by <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> - Rev and <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - Rev fusion proteins ( fig. 5 B ) . ||9557739_1025_155871==>The <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - Rev protein was considerably more active , resulting in 37 - fold activation versus 4.8 - fold activation by the <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> - Rev protein . ||9557739_1025_155871==>The observation that <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> targeted to a nascent RNA element , in the absence of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> , can activate HIV - 1 LTR - driven gene expression is consistent with the suggestion that <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> can act as a transcription activator . ||9557739_1025_155871==>The relatively low levels of activation by <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> - Rev may indicate that other factors , such as its cyclin partner or additional <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> components , are needed to reconstitute the total functional entity that is interfaced by <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> . ||9557739_1025_155871==>While this report was in preparation , we became aware of two recent studies describing the involvement of <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> in <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transactivation ( 25 , 47 ) . ||9557739_1025_155871==>Using an vitro transcription assay , both studies demonstrated that <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> is required for <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transactivation in vitro . ||9557739_1025_155871==>Additionally , one study also investigated the effect of transient overexpression of <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> on <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transactivation in vivo ( 25 ) ; however , those data , in contrast to the results presented here , indicate activation of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> function by overexpression of wild - type <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> . ||9557739_1025_155871==>However , our finding that overexpression of wild - type <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> can inhibit <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> function is consistent with the proposal that <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> functions in vivo as a multiprotein complex . ||9557739_1025_155871==>In agreement with our results , in this recent study it was also observed that a catalytic mutant of <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> does inhibit <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transactivation ( 25 ) . ||9557739_1025_155871==>Taken together , recent work by several laboratories has demonstrated that <PROT1_1025>  PITALRE </PROT1_1025> does , indeed , mediate <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transactivation . 

stabilizes=====14561767_155945_468==>We showed that the expression of a <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> - green fluorescent fusion protein prevented the proteosomal degradation of TrCP substrates such as - catenin , I B , and <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> , which are normally directly targeted to the proteasome for degradation . ||14561767_155945_468==>The overexpression of <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> also provoked accumulation of - catenin , but to a lower level than that resulting from the expression of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> . ||14561767_155945_468==>The signal for the recognition of all these cellular ligands by TrCP is the phosphorylation of one or two serine residues present in a conserved motif , DSG XX S for <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> , - catenin , and I B and DSG XXX S for <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> , p105 , and p100 . ||14561767_155945_468==>HeLa cells were transiently transfected by electroporation when using plasmids encoding HA - <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> , <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> - GFP , Vpuc - GFP , or TrCP - FLAG or by the calcium method when using pNL4 - 3 or its variants . ||14561767_155945_468==>Western Blotting Analysis �Samples containing 8 x 10 6 HeLa cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with Vpuc - GFP , Vpuc2.6 - GFP , <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> - GFP , Vpu2.6 - GFP , or HA - <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> . ||14561767_155945_468==>Expression of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> Results in Accumulation of <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> �To examine whether <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> , a newly identified substrate of TrCP , accumulated in the presence of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> like - catenin and I B , we analyzed the effect of Vpuc - GFP on cells co - transfected with HA - <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> expression vector . ||14561767_155945_468==>A , expression of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> - GFP in HeLa cells results in accumulation of transfected HA - <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> . ||14561767_155945_468==>B , expression of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> - GFP has a stronger effect on the accumulation of endogenous - catenin than does the expression of HA - <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> . ||14561767_155945_468==>In conclusion , these data suggest that <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> is a more potent competitive inhibitor of TrCP for the inhibition of - catenin degradation than the overproduced <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> . ||14561767_155945_468==>In fact , - catenin , I B , and <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> accumulate , and the transcriptional activity of - catenin is up - regulated in the presence of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> . ||14561767_155945_468==>The accumulation of <PROT2_468>  ATF4 </PROT2_468> as a result of <PROT1_155945>  Vpu </PROT1_155945> production might disrupt the metabolism of T cells infected by HIV - 1 . ||8764062_155871_2958==>Interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> with a unique site of TFIID inhibits negative cofactor Dr1 and stabilizes the TFIID - <PROT2_2958>  TFIIA </PROT2_2958> complex - - Kashanchi et al. 70 ( 8 ) : 5503 - - The Journal of Virology

containing P - TEFb complex . ||10866664_1025_155871==>The results presented in fig. 9 B demonstrate several important points about the functional interaction between <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> and <PROT1_1025>  CDK9 </PROT1_1025> . ||10866664_1025_155871==>First , in the absence of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> , <PROT1_1025>  CDK9 </PROT1_1025> phosphorylates the CTD at serine 2 but not at serine 5 ( fig. 9 B , lane 1 ) . ||10866664_1025_155871==>The addition of a <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> mutant containing an amino acid substitution at cysteine 22 failed to increase <PROT1_1025>  CDK9 </PROT1_1025> activity ( fig. 9 B , top , compare lane 1 with lanes 2 to 5 ) . ||10866664_1025_155871==>Remarkably , in the presence of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> , <PROT1_1025>  CDK9 </PROT1_1025> was also able to phosphorylate serine 5 ( bottom , compare lane 1 with lanes 6 to 9 ) . ||10866664_1025_155871==>In results similar to those presented in fig. 6 , the addition of low concentrations of DRB to the kinase reactions inhibited serine 2 and serine 5 phosphorylation by <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - induced <PROT1_1025>  CDK9 </PROT1_1025> ( fig. 9 C ) . ||10866664_1025_155871==>These results provide direct evidence that <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> modifies the substrate specificity of the <PROT1_1025>  CDK9 </PROT1_1025> enzyme and that the induction of kinase activity observed in the presence of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> is primarily due to phosphorylation at serine 5 . ||10866664_1025_155871==>Ramanathan et al. have recently reported that serine 5 is essential for phosphorylation by the <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> complex ( <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - P - TEFb complex ) ( 55 ) . ||10866664_1025_155871==>Mutation of serines 2 and 7 did not affect the activity of the <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> - <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> complex . ||10866664_1025_155871==>Recent studies strongly imply that the <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> cofactor is a cellular protein kinase termed <PROT1_1025>  TAK </PROT1_1025> which interacts with the activation domain of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> and phosphorylates CTD ( 21 , 22 , 79 ) . ||10866664_1025_155871==>The results presented in this study further suggest that the ability of <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> to alter the substrate specificity of <PROT1_1025>  CDK9 </PROT1_1025> would allow the continued hyperphosphorylation of the RNAP II CTD at serine 2 and serine 5 in the <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> transcription elongation complex . ||10866664_1025_155871==>The results presented in the latter study demonstrate that <PROT2_155871>  Tat </PROT2_155871> , in fact , does modify the activity of the P - TEFb - associated <PROT1_1025>  CDK9 </PROT1_1025> kinase , altering the specificity of CTD phosphorylation to allow <PROT1_1025>  CDK9 </PROT1_1025> to phosphorylate serine 5 . ||12444143_155807_8685==>HIV -

suppresses=====12167863_155459_60489==>Here , we describe a unique cellular gene , <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> , whose transient or stable expression in cells that do not normally express <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> recreates this phenotype , but whose antiviral action is overcome by the presence of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Because the <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> : <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> regulatory circuit is critical for HIV - 1 replication , perturbing the circuit may be a promising target for future HIV / AIDS therapies . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Varying doses of pCEM15 : HA ( a vector that encodes an epitope - tagged version of the predicted 384 - amino - acid open reading frame of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> ) were co - transfected with either wild - type or <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> versions of an X4 provirus expression vector and an internal control luciferase - expressing plasmid . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Figure 3 Expression of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> in permissive cells inhibits the infectivity of HIV - 1 / <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> . ||12167863_155459_60489==>In contrast to the wild - type virus , which was largely unaffected by <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> expression , the <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virus displayed minimal levels of infection at all doses of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> tested ( for example , 97 % reduction in infectivity with a sixfold excess of <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> provirus over pCEM15 : HA , relative to provirus alone ) . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Whole - cell lysates from one set of <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> transfections were also examined by immunoblotting to confirm the titration curve for <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> : HA expression ( fig. 3c ) , and for luciferase expression to establish that <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> does not affect cell physiology or gene expression in a pleiotropic manner ( fig. 3d ) . ||12167863_155459_60489==>The effects of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> on virus infectivity were essentially the same as for the X4 viruses , thus demonstrating that the inhibition of <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> infection by <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> is not strain specific . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Taken together , these data reveal that <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> shows all the features expected for a gene that establishes the non - permissive phenotype ; that is , its expression in permissive cells inhibits <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virus production qualitatively ( inhibition of infectivity ) , but not quantitatively . ||12167863_155459_60489==>In contrast , the <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> - expressing cells allowed robust replication by the wild - type virus , but low or no detectable <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virus growth ( for example , for the challenges with an intermediate inoculum ( fig. 4b ) , there was a roughly 300 - fold reduction in output of <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virus relative to wild - type virus at day 10 ) . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Although we suspect that a lack of adequate <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> expression in a subset of the cells accounts for the residual levels of HIV - 1 / <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> replication in cultures challenged with higher doses , the possible contribution of other genes to the complete non - permissive phenotype can not be ruled out 11 . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Figure 4 Stable expression of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> in CEM - SS cells selectively inhibits HIV - 1 / <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> replication . ||12167863_155459_60489==>To determine whether <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> influences <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> incorporation , and whether <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> itself can be packaged , wild -

infectious in non - permissive cells remains to be determined . ||12167863_155459_60489==><PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> is an efficient and specific inhibitor of HIV - 1 / <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> infectivity . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Because <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> is selectively expressed in non - permissive cells ( fig. 2 ) , and its anti - HIV phenotype is readily overcome by the levels of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> expressed during normal HIV - 1 replication ( fig. 4 ) , we assert that the <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> protein is the human cell target for <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> function . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Because apobec - 1 binds to and edits mRNA 18 , and because <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> has been reported not only to bind viral genomic RNA but also to depend on this interaction for normal incorporation into virions 20 - 22 , <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> may affect <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virions through their RNA components . ||12167863_155459_60489==>On the basis of these findings , we propose that <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> comprises a significant part ( or all ) of a form of innate antiviral resistance that acts during the late stages of the viral life cycle , and suggest that relieving its suppression by <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> may lend a fresh perspective to the area of HIV / AIDS therapies . ||12167863_155459_60489==>Immunoblotting and luciferase assays <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> : HA , the heterogeneous nuclear ( hn ) RNP C1 / 2 proteins , p24 Gag and <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> were detected in whole - cell lysates ( transfected or transduced cultures ) or lysates of purified virions using the 16B12 ( Covance ) , 4F4 , 24 - 3 or 319 monoclonal antibodies 30 , respectively , for primary hybridization and enhanced chemiluminescence . ||12600646_155459_3055==>Current research suggests an association of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> with the intermediate filament protein , vimentin , and the tyrosine kinase , <PROT2_3055>  Hck </PROT2_3055> , but the significance of these associations remains to be defined . ||12600646_155459_3055==>Using a GST pull down assay researchers found that GST - <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> specifically interacts with the tyrosine kinase , <PROT2_3055>  Hck </PROT2_3055> ( Hassaine et al. , 2001 ) . ||12600646_155459_3055==>Overexpression of <PROT2_3055>  Hck </PROT2_3055> was found to have an inhibitory effect on HIV - 1 replication in the absence of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> . ||12600646_155459_3055==>While <PROT2_3055>  Hck </PROT2_3055> is expressed at lower levels in H9 cells it is not detectable in CD4 + T - cells , thus the significance of the <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> / <PROT2_3055>  Hck </PROT2_3055> interaction in non - permissive cells remains to be elucidated and further work will be required to fully understand the biological significance of this interaction . ||12719574_155459_60489==>Evidence suggests that <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> acts late in the viral life cycle during assembly , budding , and / or maturation to counteract the antiviral activity of the <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> protein and possibly other antiviral factors . ||12719574_155459_60489==>Recently , we have used gene transfer experiments to show that the <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> protein ( also termed <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> ( 37 ) ) is at least partially responsible for this antiviral activity ( 55 ) ; whether <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> interacts directly with this protein is unknown . ||12719574_155459_60489==>We have recently reported that an epitope - tagged version of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> , the T - cell - expressed antiviral factor that is counteracted by <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> , is incorporated in HIV - 1 particles when overexpressed in virus - producing cells ( 55 ) . ||12719574_155459_60489==>Once antibodies are developed to endogenous <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> , it will be important to determine whether this protein is differentially encapsidated into wild - type and <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virions under physiological conditions . ||12719574_155459_60489==>Since <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> shares significant sequence similarity with cytidine deaminases ( 55 ) , it is plausible that viral ( or even cellular ) RNAs ( messenger , genomic , or ) or DNAs are subjected to sequence modification in nonpermissive cells in the absence of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> . ||12719574_155459_60489==>Nevertheless , in view of the potential deaminase activity of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> , an intriguing possibility is that <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> protects against <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> - mediated RNA modifications via its ability to associate with RNA ( 17 , 39 , 68 ) . ||12719574_155459_60489==>In any case , it can be expected that a molecular description of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> function will suggest additional aspects of <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virion structure , composition , and activity that should be assayed . ||12830140_155459_60489==><PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> was identified in the non - permissive human T cell line ( CEM ) as a gene whose product does not allow propagation of virion infectivity factor ( <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> ) �deficient HIV 5 . ||12830140_155459_60489==>Accordingly , expression of <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> in cell lines that normally support growth of <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> - deficient virus ( for example , CEM - SS or 293T 5 ) renders them resistant to its growth . ||12830140_155459_60489==>HIV <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> can counteract <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> - mediated immunity , but how this occurs is not yet known . ||12830140_155459_60489==>The <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> - dependent minus - strand dC dT transition mutations accumulated to a great extent only in the absence of the HIV <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> protein 1 - 4 . ||12830140_155459_60489==>Expression of HIV <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> in virus - producing cells was able to reverse most of the antiviral effects attributable to <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> . ||12830140_155459_60489==>How <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> inhibits <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> and thereby facilitates viral infectivity is unknown , although ( and perhaps not unexpectedly ) a balance between the activities of these two proteins is probably an important factor in determining overall infectivity . ||12830140_155459_60489==>In support of this , readily detectable dC dT transition mutations were still apparent in wild - type ( <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> + ) HIV grown on <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> - expressing cells 2 , and transient <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> expression was able to fully restore infectivity of murine leukemia virus produced on a stable <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> - expressing cell line but only partially restored it on a sister clone expressing threefold more <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> 3 . ||12830140_155459_60489==>Indeed , such severance could explain the observation that <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> - deficient HIV grown in <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> cells can synthesize but not accumulate normal amounts of DNA replication intermediates after infection of susceptible target cells 27 . ||12830140_155459_60489==>Clearly , just as these advances have answered many questions , many new ones have arisen ( How is <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> targeted to the viral DNA ? ) and some older ones have been re - emphasized ( How does <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> work to counteract <PROT2_60489>  APOBEC3G </PROT2_60489> ? ) . ||12970355_155459_60489==><PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> functions to counteract an anti - HIV - 1 cellular factor in non - permissive cells , <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> / Apobec - 3G , which shares a cytidine deaminase motif . ||12970355_155459_60489==>However , precise mechanisms how exactly the enzymatic activity of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> / Apobec - 3G regulates the virion infectivity and how <PROT1_155459>  Vif </PROT1_155459> protein overcomes the function of this protein remain unclear . ||12970355_155459_60489==>We transfected pNL43 - Luc ( WT ) or pNL43 / <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> - Luc ( <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> ) together with pcDNA4 / His - <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> ( A ) or pDON / EGFP - <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> ( B ) ( an increasing amount of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> / Apobec -

Luc or pNL43 / <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> - Luc together with a mock - vector or expression vectors for <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> / Apobec - 3G or its mutants by the calcium phosphate method . ||12970355_155459_60489==>Expression of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> / Apobec - 3G Is Sufficient for Non - permissive Phenotype� First , we transfected pcDNA4 / His - <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> or pDON / EGFP - <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> together with pNL43 / Luc ( WT ) or pNL43 / <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> - Luc ( <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> ) into HEK293T cells , prepared viruses , and tested the infectivity . ||12970355_155459_60489==>As shown in fig. 1 , transient expression of His - <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> or EGFP - <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> clearly suppressed the infectivity of <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virions in a dose - dependent manner as reported previously ( 6 ) . ||12970355_155459_60489==>This indicated that His - and EGFP - tagged protein could suppress the infectivity of <PROT1_155459>  vif </PROT1_155459> virions and that expression of <PROT2_60489>  CEM15 </PROT2_60489> / apobec - 3G was sufficient to give non -

2 and - 3 to activate the <PROT2_356>  FasL </PROT2_356> promoter and that this requires the binding of the Egrs to the FLRE in the <PROT2_356>  FasL </PROT2_356> promoter . ||11909874_155871_356==><PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> Binds Egrs - - Because <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> enhancement of <PROT2_356>  FasL </PROT2_356> promoter transcription depends on the concomitant presence of Egr - 2 or - 3 , we asked whether these molecules interact physically . ||11909874_155871_356==>Because this region is vital for <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> - mediated gene transactivation , these results suggest that direct interaction between the activation domain of <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> and Egrs is responsible for the superinduction of the <PROT2_356>  FasL </PROT2_356> promoter . ||11909874_155871_356==>Taken together , these data argue that binding of transactivation - competent HIV <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> to the biologically active Egrs ( Egr - 2 and - 3 ) is necessary for synergism between these two transcriptional regulators at induction of the <PROT2_356>  FasL </PROT2_356> promoter . ||11909874_155871_356==>Given the fact that <PROT1_155871>  Tat </PROT1_155871> can be secreted by infected cells and detected in serum from HIV -
